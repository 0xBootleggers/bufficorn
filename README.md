## Potential Enhancements

- Adding Safes: Right now all proposals are related to Treasury. Could improve operations by have seperate safes for various functions.
- Adding Forms: We have implemented the basic forms required for onboarding partners and funding companies. Could increase transparency of operations by adding additional proposals to other common tasks in the DAO or summon other sub-daos for operations and marketing functions. Proposals to the Bufficorn Ventures DAO would then only be needed for providing the budget to those functions.
